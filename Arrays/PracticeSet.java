/*Question 23: Write a Java program to find the Majority Element of an array.
A majority element in an array of size n is an element that appears more than 
n/2 times. There can be at most one majority element in the array.
Input:
Array = [4, 8, 4, 6, 7, 4, 4, 8]

Output:
Majority Element = 4

Explanation:
Count the occurrences of every element using nested traversal and if any element 
appears more than n/2 times it is the majority element.*/
